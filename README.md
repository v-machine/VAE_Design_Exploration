# VAE Latent Design Exploration
Rhino/Grasshopper and web-based platform for latent parametric design exploration with Variational AutoEncoder.

This is a hackathon project developed during AEC Tech 2022. The team members are: Zhenxiang Huang, Vincent Mai, Daniel Gaspar, Mark Membreno, Mohsin Afsar, JP Mendez-Ruiz, Paul Laroque, Mitsuhiro Kuroki, Peter Huang. We are a diverse group with backgrounds in structural engineering, architecture, business and computational design.
